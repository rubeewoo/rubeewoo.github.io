				Did you know? Your skin is the largest organ in your body! Just like your eyes, your liver, your heart, or any other organs, your skin needs to be cared for and loved. It is important that you take good care of it. Fortunately, that is not difficult with all the products in the markets nowadays and you can find almost everything your skin needs easily. However, the complicated part is knowing which product suits your skin and how to choose them over a million other products. </p>

				<p>Firstly, you need to know your own skin type. Everyone is unique and everyone is different in terms of skin type. The experts came up with categories of skin types, which resulted in 4 major types of skins, which are normal, dry, combination and oily. Skin types are mostly determined by genetics, but it can change overtime due to external factors. The first one is normal skin, it is what people call the perfect skin type. It is neither too dry or too oily and hardly has any skin problems. Normal skin is the healthiest form of the skin type. With this skin type, the skin will look radiant and glowly. Then there is dry skin, dry skin is a skin type that is dry throughout the seasons. With this skin type, not enough sebum is being produced. Some signs of dry skin include tightness, rough patches, skin peeling and dullness all over. Sometimes itchiness will also be experienced by people with dry skin. Next is combination skin, combination skin is a type of skin that is oily on the T zone(forehead, nose and chin) and dry on the cheeks. Combination skin is also called the T zone skin due to the sebum produced there. The oily part can have signs like oily skin and the dry part can have signs like dry skin. The last major skin type is oily skin, which is often confused with dehydrated skin, is a type of skin that produces excessive sebum all over the face. Oily skin is the type of skin that creates most skin problems for people. Some signs of oily skin include enlarged pores, acnes, blackheads and shininess all over. Those are the 4 major skin types, some other skin types include dehydrated skin, sensitive skin, and acne-prone skin. </p>

					<p>Each skin type has their own set of products, it is best to not use one product for all skin types. As mentioned earlier, normal skin is pretty balanced and does not need special care so it does not require that much skincare product or specific product to fix a skin problem. Just cleanse the skin twice a day and properly hydrate the skin will make the skin look glowy and radiant. Dry skin in comparison needs more moisture compared to other types of skin. The flaky skin is caused by not enough hydration. Specialized creams or lotions that are rich with hydrating components are great for dry skins. Oils(of course not the cooking oil)  can be another good choice for dry skins to stay hydrated, they might be too greasy for other skin types but it is perfect for oily skins. Other than adding more moisture, locking in the moisture is also important. Gels or nightmask are good moisture lockers, they seal in all the products you used and let your skin absorb all the products. Next, the combination skin, which is the skin with different parts to take care of. Combination skin can use different products for different parts of the skin. For T-zone, products for oil control can be used since there are more sebum being produced at that zone. At areas beside the T-zone, more moisturizing products can be used since it is going to be drier compared to the T-zone. So products like cream and lotion can be used in those areas. Lastly, the oily skin, it is the most complicated skin out of all skin types. With oily skin, products need to be carefully chosen because of the excessive amount of sebum being produced. Products need to be labeled as non-comedogenic or oil free to suit the oily skin. Already with natural sebum, iIf the skincare product is too heavy or too oily, it is going to cause the oily skin to break out and cause skin problems.</p>
