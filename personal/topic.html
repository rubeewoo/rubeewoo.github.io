			<h2>Types of Skin</h2>

			<h3>Normal skin</h3>
			<p>
				Normal skin is what people call the perfect skin type. It is neither too dry or too oily and hardly has any skin problems. Normal skin is the healthiest form of the skin type. 
			</p>

		<section>
			<h3>Dry skin</h3>
			<p>
				Dry skin is a skin type that is dry throughout the seasons. With this skin type, not enough sebum is being produced. Some signs of dry skin include tightness, rough patches, skin peeling and dullness all over. 
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Combination skin</h3>
			<p>
				Combination skin is a type of skin that is oily on the T zone(forehead, nose and chin) and dry on the cheeks. Combination skin is also called the T zone skin due to the sebum produced there.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Oily skin</h3>
			<p>
				Oily skin, often confused with dehydrated skin, is a type of skin that produces excessive sebum all over the face. Oily skin is the type of skin that creates most skin problems for people. Some signs of oily skin include enlarged pores, acnes, blackheads and shininess all over.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>Some other skin types can include: dehydrated skin and sensitive skin.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Skin care for each skin type</h2>
			<p>Skin care is essential in our daily life to protect our skin against the harsh environment. </p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Normal skin</h3>
			<p>
				Normal skin is pretty balanced so it doesnâ€™t require that much skincare product. Just cleanse the skin twice a day and properly hydrate the skin.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Dry skin</h3>
			<p>
				Dry skin needs more moisture compared to other types of skin. Other than adding more moisture, locking in the moisture is also important. So dry skins should use oil based skincare products and then use a final product to lock in all the moisture.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Combination skin</h3>
			<p>
				Combination skin can use different products for different parts of the skin. For T-zone, products for oil control can be used since there are more sebum being produced at that zone. At areas beside the T-zone, more moisturizing products can be used since it is going to be drier compared to the T-zone.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Oily skin</h3>
			<p>
				Oily skin needs to be careful when choosing skincare products because of the excessive amount of sebum being produced. Products need to be labeled as non-comedogenic or oil free to suit the oily skin. If the product is too heavy or too oily, it is going to cause the oily skin to break out.
