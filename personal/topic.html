			<h3>Normal skin</h3>
			<p>
				Normal skin is pretty balanced so it doesnâ€™t require that much skincare product. Just cleanse the skin twice a day and properly hydrate the skin.

			<h3>Dry skin</h3>
			<p>
				Dry skin needs more moisture compared to other types of skin. Other than adding more moisture, locking in the moisture is also important. So dry skins should use oil based skincare products and then use a final product to lock in all the moisture.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Combination skin</h3>
			<p>
				Combination skin can use different products for different parts of the skin. For T-zone, products for oil control can be used since there are more sebum being produced at that zone. At areas beside the T-zone, more moisturizing products can be used since it is going to be drier compared to the T-zone.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h3>Oily skin</h3>
			<p>
				Oily skin needs to be careful when choosing skincare products because of the excessive amount of sebum being produced. Products need to be labeled as non-comedogenic or oil free to suit the oily skin. If the product is too heavy or too oily, it is going to cause the oily skin to break out.
