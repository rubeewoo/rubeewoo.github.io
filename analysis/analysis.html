			<h1>Structural Analysis</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
				<p>In the opening paragraph <a href="example.html#sec1">[Sec. #1]</a>, the first sentence as highlighted in the following quotes would be the thesis statement. Firstly it would be because of the <q> biodiversity loss </q> in the sentence, which is the central idea of this article and it is also a part of the article title.
		
				<p><q> <span style="background-color: #80cdc1;"> Corporate Australia is familiar with the concept that climate change presents a financial risk to the global economy, but more recently biodiversity loss has emerged as an equally important risk.</span>  In fact, climate change and biodiversity loss are now often referred to as the “twin crises” facing the global financial system and awareness of the role the financial sector plays in this is rising swiftly.</q></p>

				<h2>Coherence & Cohesion</h2>

				<h3><a href="example.html#sec2">[Sec. #2]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - The first paragraph of Section #2 is the paragraph following the thesis paragraph, so it is started with <q>Crucially</q>, to continue on the topic of biodiversity loss and the importance of it. This paragraph also talks about how <q>economic system is dependent on biodiversity, which makes it clear that it is one of the subtopic of this article.</q></li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - The second paragraph of this section continues on the topic of how fincancial and economics are connected to the nature and biodiversity. The phrase<q> potential parallels between nature risk and other responsibilities of financial institutions</q> made it clear that the author is making connections between economics and biodiversity.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In the second sentence of the first paragraph, <q>biodiversity is declining</q>, the author is saying that biodiveristy is disappearing. The author then uses <q>biodiversity loss</q> in the second paragraph to <b>paraphrase</b> the phrase in the first paragraph.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - This paragraphs starts with <q>In this context</q>, which is signaling the readers that there is a new topic coming up. Then the second setnence of this paragraph has the phrase <q>the TNFD will develop a framework</q>, talking about the work that is going to be done. That is why the subtopic is "Work Being Done to End Nature Risks".</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - From <q>This ambitious scope of work</q> at the start of paragraph 2, it is clear that the subtopic of doing something to end nature related risks is being continued. This paragraph also talks about what Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is going to do.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In this paragraph, the technique <b>repitition</b> is being used because the term <q>TNFD</q> has been repeated seveal times throughout the paragraph and in all three sentences of this paragraph. The first sentence: <q>...with the TNFD officially under way...</q>. The second sentence: <q>...the recommendations of the TNFD are likely to...</q>. The third sentence: <q>Ultimately, the TNFD also...</q>.</li>
				</ul>


				<h3><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #4]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - This paragraph starts with <q>Perhaps most importantly for Australian company directors</q>, which is telling the reader a new subtopic is coming up because it is no longer talking about what are being done to end the nature related risk.</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - The second paragraph starts with <q>For example</q>, which means it is a continuation of the previous paragraph because there is an example being given to help with the author's statement. It is also a smooth transition word connecting the last paragraph and this paragraph.</li>

					<li><b>Para #3</b> - The final paragraph of this section starts with <q>In terms of transition risks</q>, which means the author is going to talk about another type of risk, which is related to the subtopic 'Types of Risks. </li>

				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In this paragraph, <b>repitition</b> is used to connect the sub-paragraphs. The phrase <q>nature risks</q> has appeared in all 3 sub-paragraphs of this paragraph, linking them to talk about the same idea.</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In this paragraph <b>paraphrasing</b> and <b>repitition</b> are being used. The <b>paraphrasing</b> occurs between the first and second sub-paragraphs. The first sub-paragraph used <q> nature-related physical risks</q> while the second sub-paragraph used <q>physical nature-related risk</q>. The wording of this phrase is slightly different, but the meaning is nonetheless the same. The <b>repitition</b> occurs between the second and third sub-paragraphs. Both sub-paragraphs are talking about the bees and why the bees are important.

					<li><b>Para #3</b> - In this paragraph<b>repitition</b>, <b>paraphrasing</b>, and <b>linkers</b> are being used. The <b>repitition</b> and <b>paraphrasing</b> are merged together because the idea revolves around <q>investors</q> and <q>investment</q>, which has the same word root invest. The technique<b>linkers</b> is being used because <q>On the investment front</q> here is similar to 'On the other hand' we use as a transitional phrase.
					</li>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - This paragraph used the phrase <q>When all of these factors are taken together</q>, that means the author is summarizing their points and is concluding.</li>

				<h2>Take-home Message</h2>
				<p>
					The last paragraph of this article is the take-home message that the author wants to give the readers. This 2 sentence paragraph is something the author wrote to warn all people, especially the Australian companies. Nature risk is the central idea throughout the whole article; talking about how nature risk is imporant and how it can affect the economics. It is mentioned that climate risk was a worldwide problem and if people are not careful, then nature risk could become the next climate risk, which is not a good thing. The author wants people to be careful not to do more harm to nature.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="backgroun-color: #80cdc1;"> When all of these factors are taken together, it is clear that nature risk will become the next climate risk.</span> <q>Australian directors should take steps now to avoid being caught flat-footed on nature risk.</q>
