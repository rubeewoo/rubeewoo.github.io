				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - The first paragraph of Section #2 is the paragraph following the thesis paragraph, so it is started with <q>Crucially</q>, to continue on the topic of biodiversity loss and the importance of it. This paragraph also talks about how <q>economic system is dependent on biodiversity, which makes it clear that it is one of the subtopic of this article.</q></li>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - The second paragraph of this section continues on the topic of how fincancial and economics are connected to the nature and biodiversity. The phrase<q> potential parallels between nature risk and other responsibilities of financial institutions</q> made it clear that the author is making connections between economics and biodiversity.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In the second sentence of the first paragraph, <q>biodiversity is declining</q>, the author is saying that biodiveristy is disappearing. The author then uses <q>biodiversity loss</q> in the second paragraph to <b>paraphrase</b> the phrase in the first paragraph.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #3]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - This paragraphs starts with <q>In this context</q>, which is signaling the readers that there is a new topic coming up. Then the second setnence of this paragraph has the phrase <q>the TNFD will develop a framework</q>, talking about the work that is going to be done. That is why the subtopic is "Work Being Done to End Nature Risks".</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - From <q>This ambitious scope of work</q> at the start of paragraph 2, it is clear that the subtopic of doing something to end nature related risks is being continued.

					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In this paragraph, the technique <b>repitition</b> is being used because the term <q>TNFD</q> has been repeated seveal times throughout the paragraph and in all three sentences of this paragraph. The first sentence: <q>...with the TNFD officially under way...</q>. The second sentence: <q>...the recommendations of the TNFD are likely to...</q>. The third sentence: <q>Ultimately, the TNFD also...</q>.</li>
				</ul>


				<h3><a href="example.html#sec3">[Sec. #4]</a></h3>
				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #dfc27d; color: white;">Coherence</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - This paragraph starts with <q>Perhaps most importantly for Australian company directors</q>, which is telling the reader a new subtopic is coming up because it is no longer talking about what are being done to end the nature related risks, it is focusing on what is important for company directors.</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - The second paragraph starts with <q>For example</q>, which means it is a continuation of the previous paragraph because there is an example being given to help with the author's statement. It is also a smooth transition word connecting the last paragraph and this paragraph.</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="cc"><span style="background-color: #a6611a; color: white;">Cohesion</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Para #1</b> - In this paragraph, <b>repitition</b> is used to connect the sub-paragraphs. The phrase <q>nature risks</q> has appeared in all 3 sub-paragraphs of this paragraph, linking them to talk about the same idea.</li>

					<li><b>Para #2</b> - In this paragraph <b>paraphrasing</b> and <b>repitition</b> are being used. The <b>paraphrasing</b> occurs between the first and second sub-paragraphs. The first sub-paragraph used <q> nature-related physical risks</q> while the second sub-paragraph used <q>physical nature-related risk</q>. The wording of this phrase is slightly different, but the meaning is nonetheless the same. The <b>repitition</b> occurs between the second and third sub-paragraphs. Both sub-paragraphs are talking about the bees and why the bees are important.
